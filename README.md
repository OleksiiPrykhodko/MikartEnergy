# MikartEnergy

This is my pet project. 
I decided to create the website of a fictitious company that automates production processes in the chemical industry and sells industrial automation. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
